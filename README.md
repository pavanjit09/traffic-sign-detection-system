# 🚦 Traffic Sign Recognition System using Deep Learning

## 🔍 Overview
The Traffic Sign Recognition System is an advanced AI-powered application that accurately classifies traffic signs using a deep learning model trained on real-world datasets. This system can assist in autonomous driving, road safety applications, and smart traffic management by identifying road signs.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ **Deep Learning-Powered** – Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- ✅ **High Accuracy** – Achieves 96.5% test accuracy on traffic sign datasets
- ✅ **User -Friendly Interface** – Simple file upload system for image-based recognition
- ✅ **Automated Image Preprocessing** – Converts images to grayscale, normalizes, and enhances contrast
- ✅ **Robust Model Training** – Uses data augmentation to improve generalization
- ✅ **Real-Time Predictions** – Instantly classifies traffic signs from uploaded images
- ✅ **Optimized Performance** – Reduces inference time for faster results

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- 🔹 **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- 🔹 **Backend**: Flask
- 🔹 **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn
- 🔹 **Dataset Processing**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

## 📸 How It Works 
- Upload an image of a traffic sign. The model preprocesses the image and classifies it. The predicted traffic sign is displayed on the screen.
